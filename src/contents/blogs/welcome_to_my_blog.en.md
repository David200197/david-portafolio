# Welcome to My Programming Blog!

<img src="/david-portafolio/blogs/welcome_to_my_blog.jpg" alt="JavaScript Logo" class="img-blog" />

Hi everyone, I'm David. This is the first of many posts I plan to share on my portfolio. I’d like to briefly tell you what these blogs will be about, why I’m writing them, and what you can expect going forward.

## Topics You'll Find Here

In this space, I’ll be sharing experiences, lessons learned, and personal reflections I’ve gathered throughout my journey as a developer. Some of the topics I’ll cover include:

- Solutions to real-world problems I’ve encountered.
- Best practices in programming.
- Personal opinions on tools or methodologies.
- Personal projects and proof-of-concept experiments.
- Explorations of technologies I’m still learning.

The idea is for this blog to serve as a personal log, but also as a helpful resource for other developers.

## Why Did I Start a Blog?

I’ve wanted a space for a while where I could record my ideas, clarify common doubts, and share what I’m learning. Not just as a personal documentation tool, but also as a way to give back to the community.

Over my more than 4 years of experience as a developer, I’ve often relied on blog posts, tutorials, and forums written by others. They’ve helped me solve specific problems in my daily work, and now I’d like to give something back.

## Do I Have Future Plans?

Yes! In addition to the blog, I’m planning to add more sections to my portfolio, such as:

- A lab for experimenting with new ideas and technologies.
- A space to publish side projects and document their progress.
- Possibly sections dedicated to books, useful tools, or interviews.

The idea is for this site to grow with me, adapting to my interests and needs over time.
