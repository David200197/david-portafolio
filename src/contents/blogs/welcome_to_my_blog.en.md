# Why I started this blog (and what you will find here)

<img src="/david-portafolio/blogs/welcome_to_my_blog.webp" alt="Welcome to the blog" class="img-blog" />

Hi, I'm David.

I've been working as a developer for over 4 years, and during all that time I've lost count of how many times a random blog post saved my day. That guy who documented how he fixed an obscure webpack bug at 3 AM, the person who explained a complex concept with clear examples, the tutorial that saved me hours of frustration.

I'll never meet those people, but I owe them a lot.

This blog is my way of paying it forward.

## What you'll find here

I'm not going to write generic tutorials that already exist on a thousand sites. The idea is to share things I wish I had found when I needed them:

- **Real problems and how I solved them** — with context, not just the code that worked
- **Honest opinions about tools** — the good, the bad, and when it makes sense to use them
- **Things I'm learning** — because explaining something is the best way to understand it
- **Personal projects** — the process, not just the end result

Basically, a development logbook that I hope will be useful to someone else.

## What's coming

Besides the blog, I have plans to add other sections to the portfolio:

- A space to experiment with new technologies
- Documentation of side projects as I build them
- Maybe recommendations for books and tools I use

The site will keep growing. For now, this is the starting point.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. See you in the next post.
